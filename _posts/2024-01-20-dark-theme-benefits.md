Dark themes have become the default choice for many applications and websites. Here's why they're so popular and effective.

## The Science Behind Dark Themes

Research shows several benefits of dark interfaces:

### Reduced Eye Strain
- Lower blue light emission
- Better for extended reading sessions
- Particularly helpful in low-light environments

### Improved Battery Life
OLED displays consume less power when displaying darker colors, making dark themes more energy-efficient.

### Better Focus
Dark backgrounds help content stand out, creating a more immersive reading experience.

## Design Considerations

When implementing dark themes, consider:

```css
:root {
  --bg-primary: #263238;
  --text-primary: #e0e0e0;
  --accent: #64b5f6;
  --border: #455a64;
}

.dark-theme {
  background: var(--bg-primary);
  color: var(--text-primary);
  border-color: var(--border);
}
```

## The islog Approach

This theme demonstrates best practices:

- **High contrast ratios** for accessibility
- **Carefully selected colors** that work together
- **Optimized typography** for long-form reading

Dark themes aren't just a trendâ€”they're a thoughtful design choice that prioritizes user comfort and functionality.
